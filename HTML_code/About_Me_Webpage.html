I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection (1-2 paragraphs): After completing this assignment, I understand the HTML structure a lot better. 
I was able to see how simple the tags are and how the CSS page can interact with the main document. 
I also learned how to make tables and format them properly.

I had some troubles in this assignment with some of the more advanced things.
For instance, getting the colors on the table to show up properly, and aligning the image to the right side of the page.
Unexpectedly, one of the biggest challenges wasn't the code at all, it was uploading the image of myself from my phone, which didn't want to work with me.
Overall, I think the page turned out pretty good.

            <h2>My personal interest</h2>
            <p>One of my favorite interests is Star Wars, and not limited to the movies. 
                It's a dead giveaway that I enjoy this series since one of my favorite books is Heir to the Empire by Timothy Zahn. 
                I enjoy the lore and world and keep up with new shows, movies, and games whenever they come out.
                The movies and shows are pretty good for the most part, and I enjoy the world and design of the ships, plannets, and aliens.</p>
            <p>Another big interest of mine is Dungeons and Dragons. 
                I have played it since high school and have continued to play it through college.
                The biggest thing I like about it is the way you can tell stories with your friends in a collaborative way.
                I have played as a Dungeon Master and a player, and have had a lot of fun as both roles. 
                I prefer being a Dungeon Master since I like to build the story around the characters, and make their actions have consequences.</p>
            <p>I am really big into video games, it's my favorite pass time. 
                Some of my favorite game series include Half-Life & Portal, Frostpunk, and Red Dead Redemption. 
                I play a variety of other games, and it changes every so often, but I mainly enjoy the story and world of the games I play. 
                I also enjoy a good challenge of strategy and tactics in games, and I enjoy good horror games like Phasmophobia, Dead Space, and Fears to Fathom.</p>
